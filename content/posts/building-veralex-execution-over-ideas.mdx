Thursday afternoon, putting my tired body into the metro near Farragut North, while waiting for my train, I came across a Shorts featuring Steve Jobs clip where he was answering questions from a small conference (maybe of college students and working professionals). *I miss Steve a lot. I know there are controversies surrounding him, yet our society needed him and his work was truly remarkable.*

During *our* question he asked Steve, "when you here were marketing or executing?". The clip wasn't showing how many students raised their hands, but I could tell only three or four raised their hands. Jobs nodded as if that made sense giving some positive signals. Then he asked second question, "how about consulting– anyone? consulting?" Again, with the clip didn't show, maybe many?, but I am sure the difference was huge, so I could tell a lot more hands went up.

Jobs, half-joking and half-serious, responded with a kind of disappointed sigh— *yeah, he indeed had no learn–* *I don't know what you're gonna do, but in the near future, I don't think manufacturing.* Showing the difference between saying you've owned something– actually owned and built something with real substance– he legitimately made an emphasis: "You need to work on something real. There's a huge difference between saying you've owned something versus actually working on something you've made."

I'll be honest, someone like me can't fully claim to understand the mindset of an engineering world all-star like Jobs. But Jobs was pointing to the kind of insight you only gain when you execute, when you build, when you own real manage everything that the same through clearly needed in a field I'm building and thinking about execution.

Now some people are saying that the second closet job in the near future would be those manufacturing workers who deal with all the lines, chips, fixing and managing data center's infrastructures. However, what I know is that not only US but many numbers of countries in leading part of the world, they are lacking or exporting out their capacity related to manufacturing. We may need a whole new section or article or pages that dives into why the LLM-related area (or all of cloud and compute) is at risk if we diminish.

I don't think Steve was only visaging IT-related manufacturing jobs as a good area for one's own execution. I know he legitimately meant and he was saying themselves also, that their product should a matter that much. For us, Jay and I, we have a Legal AI project as our own area of execution. For our current matter, even if it's just one person at first, putting it in someone's hands and selling our service is our current matter of execution.
