# From B2B to B2A: Your Next Lawyer Might Be Hired by an AI

I've been thinking about something that sounds almost absurd when you say it out loud: what if the next time you need a lawyer, you don't actually go find one yourself? What if your AI does it for you?

Not in some sci-fi, ten-years-from-now way. I mean soon. Maybe already.

## The two tracks we've been stuck on

Legal services have basically worked the same way forever. Either you're an individual Googling "immigration lawyer near me" at midnight (B2C), or you're a company with a legal department that has relationships with law firms (B2B). Both tracks assume a human is doing the searching, evaluating, and deciding.

But here's what I keep coming back to: that assumption is already breaking down. People are using AI to draft emails, summarize contracts, plan trips, compare insurance plans. It's not a huge leap to imagine someone saying, "Hey, handle my LLC formation" -- and then never touching the process again.

There's already a name for this: **B2A -- Business-to-AI**. And I don't just mean the AI finds you a lawyer. I mean the full loop. The AI shops for the service, engages the attorney, does the actual legwork -- filling out forms, gathering documents, going back and forth with the lawyer -- and delivers you the finished result. You say what you need. The AI does the rest.

## What this actually looks like

Let me make it concrete, because "full loop" can sound hand-wavy.

Say you need to form an LLC. Today, you Google around, find a lawyer or maybe an online filing service, fill out a bunch of forms yourself, email documents back and forth, wait, follow up, wait some more. In a B2A world? You tell your AI agent "I need to form an LLC in Delaware for my consulting business." The AI figures out the right entity structure, finds a vetted attorney with transparent pricing, fills out the formation docs and files them, and comes back to you with your operating agreement and EIN. You didn't Google anything. You didn't fill out a single form.

Or take something more personal -- a demand letter. Right now, that's a whole process: you explain your situation to a lawyer, they draft something, you go back and forth on revisions. With B2A, your AI agent gathers the facts from you in a conversation, drafts the letter, coordinates with an attorney to review and finalize it, and delivers the thing submission-ready. The attorney's expertise is still in the loop -- but the busywork isn't yours anymore.

Immigration is another good one, maybe even more obvious. Visa applications are paperwork nightmares -- dozens of forms, supporting documents, deadlines that change. Your AI agent could gather all your documents, fill out the forms, flag gaps, and work with an immigration attorney on strategy while you go about your life. The attorney focuses on the legal judgment calls. The AI handles the rest.

The point isn't that lawyers go away. They don't. The point is that the whole process -- from finding the right attorney to getting the finished work product -- collapses into something an AI can run, with attorneys brought in where their judgment actually matters.

## Why most law firms are invisible to AI

And this is the part that really gets me. If you've ever tried to figure out how much a lawyer costs before talking to them, you know the pain. Most firm websites are basically brochures. "We handle corporate law. Call for a consultation." That's it. No pricing, no clear scope, no structured data an AI could even begin to parse.

In a B2A world, that's a death sentence for visibility. An AI agent optimizing for its user isn't going to call a phone number and sit through a 30-minute intake. It's going to look for structured, transparent, machine-readable information. If it can't find that, the firm simply doesn't exist to the AI.

Remember when businesses figured out they needed a website? Like, actually needed one, not just as a digital business card? B2A is that same shift. If your services aren't structured for AI to evaluate, you're invisible to a growing chunk of how people will find help.

## This is basically why I'm building what I'm building

I'll be honest -- this isn't just an abstract observation for me. This is the thesis behind VeraLex.

We've been standardizing how clients match with attorneys for specific legal services -- visas, contracts, business formation, the stuff people actually need. Fixed pricing and clear scopes. You only pay if you hire someone. But the bigger play is building the infrastructure for that full loop. Standardized services with clear pricing aren't just nice for comparison shopping -- they're what an AI agent needs to actually *engage* a service, not just find one.

I didn't design it this way because I was thinking about AI agents two years ago. I designed it this way because the traditional process is broken for *humans* too. But it turns out that making legal services structured and transparent for people also makes them workable for AI. Same problem, same fix.

Whether you're clicking through our platform yourself today or, eventually, your AI agent is handling the entire engagement -- the infrastructure we're building is designed for both.

## The uncomfortable part

Here's the thing nobody in legal tech wants to say out loud: a lot of firms benefit from the opacity. Vague pricing means flexibility to charge more. Long intake processes mean the client is already invested before they find out the real cost. The messiness is the business model.

B2A threatens that entire model. When an AI is comparison-shopping on behalf of a client, the firms that win are the ones that make it easy to compare. The ones that actually tell you what things cost and what you're getting. Everything the traditional model avoids.

I think we'll look back pretty soon and wonder how we ever tolerated the old way. Not because AI forced the change, but because it made the alternative so obviously better that the old way just stopped making sense.

## Where this goes

I obviously can't predict the timeline. But if I had to bet, I'd say the legal industry's B2A moment is closer than most people think. The tools are already here. The behavior is already shifting. And the firms that get it won't just show up in AI search results -- they'll be firms an AI agent can actually hire. Evaluate the service, pay for it, work with the attorney, deliver the result. That's a different thing entirely from being "findable."

The only question is which firms and platforms will be built for that full loop, and which ones will still be standing there with a phone number and a "call for a consultation" button, wondering where everyone went.

We're building for the full loop. That's the whole point.
