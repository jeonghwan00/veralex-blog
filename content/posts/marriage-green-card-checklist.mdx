# Marriage Green Card Checklist: What to Gather Before You Start

Before you speak with an attorney, get organized. A clean checklist reduces stress and makes the first conversation more productive.

Immigration processes are document-heavy, and the Marriage Green Card applications are no exception. The sooner you start collecting these documents, the smoother your journey will be.

> **Note from Jay:**
> I kept seeing the same pattern: people lose weeks because they're collecting documents after the first call. This post is the admin checklist that prevents that delay.

## The Goal of a Checklist

The primary goal of this checklist is to reduce uncertainty. When you approach an attorney or start your application with a disorganized pile of documents, you risk missing critical details or duplicating work. By gathering everything upfront, you turn a chaotic process into a structured one. This preparation allows your attorney to focus on strategy rather than document hunting.

## What to Gather

Here are the key categories of documents you should start gathering immediately. This is not an exhaustive list for every unique situation, but it covers the essentials for most applicants.

### 1. Identity and Entry History

Proof of who you are and how you entered the United States is foundational to your application.
*   **Passports:** Current and expired passports for both spouses.
*   **Birth Certificates:** Long-form birth certificates with certified translations if they are not in English.
*   **Government ID:** Driver's licenses or other state-issued IDs.
*   **Entry Records:** Copies of your I-94 (Arrival/Departure Record), visa stamps, and any other entry documents.
*   **Social Security Cards:** If applicable.

### 2. Prior Filings and Notices

If you have ever interacted with immigration authorities before, those records are vital.
*   **Previous Petitions:** Copies of any prior immigration applications (I-130, I-129F, etc.) filed by you or for you.
*   **Notices of Action (Form I-797):** Approval or receipt notices from USCIS.
*   **Court Records:** If you have ever been in immigration court proceedings.

### 3. Relationship Evidence

You must prove that your marriage is bona fide—meaning it is real and not just for immigration purposes.
*   **Marriage Certificate:** The official government-issued certificate.
*   **Joint Financials:** Joint bank account statements, credit card statements, or tax returns.
*   **Lease or Mortgage:** Documents showing both names on the residence.
*   **Photos:** A curated selection of photos spanning the length of your relationship (dating, wedding, holidays).
*   **Affidavits:** Letters from friends and family attesting to your relationship (though these are often secondary to objective evidence).

### 4. Timeline Constraints

Be aware of any dates that might affect your application strategy.
*   **Visa Expiration:** Know exactly when your current status expires.
*   **90-Day Rule Considerations:** Be mindful of your intent upon entry if you recently arrived on a non-immigrant visa.
*   **Travel Plans:** Any upcoming international travel that might conflict with filing or processing times.

## Questions to Ask an Attorney

Once you have your documents ready, you'll be in a much better position to interview attorneys. Instead of asking "What do I need?", you can ask:

*   "Based on these documents, do you see any red flags?"
*   "What is your timeline for reviewing these documents Once I hand them over?"
*   "What specific deliverables are included in your fixed fee?"
*   "How do you handle Requests for Evidence (RFEs)?"

## Next Step

Gathering these documents is the hardest part of the "admin" work. Once you have them, you are ready to formally start your request and get a clear assessment of your case.

Don't let the paperwork overwhelm you. Take it one category at a time.
